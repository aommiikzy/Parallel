\Large This report described Sieve of Eratosthenes (finding the prime number) using MPI. There are 7 points that need to explain, which include algorithm, implementation, evaluation, performance results, discussion of the results, analysis of the algorithm, and further optimization.


\section{\Large Algorithm \&  Implementation}\label{sec:algo} 

\hspace{10mm}This algorithm was separated into 2 parts which are sequential and parallel version.\\
\begin{itemize}
	\item  {\bfseries Sequential Version Algorithm [1]} 
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Create a list of unmarked natural number 2, 3,..., n
		\item k $\leftarrow$ 2
		\item Repeat
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Mark all multiples of k between $k^2$ and n.
			\item k $\leftarrow$ smallest unmarked number $>$ k until $k^2 > n$
		\end{itemize}
		\item The unmarked numbers are primes\\
	\end{enumerate}
	
        	\item {\bfseries  Parallel Version Algorithm [1]}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Create a list of unmarked natural number 2, 3,..., n. Each process creates its share of the list. 
		\item k $\leftarrow$ 2 (All process performs this)
		\item Repeat
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Mark all multiples of k between $k^2$ and n. (Each process marks its share of the list)
			\item k $\leftarrow$ smallest unmarked number $>$ (Process 0 only)
			\item Process 0 broadcasts k to rest of processes until $k^2 > n$
		\end{itemize}
		\item The unmarked numbers are primes
		\item Reduction to determine the number of primes \\
	\end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
	\item {\bfseries  Analysis of the Parallel Algorithm}
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Let $\alpha$  be the time to mark a cell.
			\item Sequential execution time: $\alpha n log log n$
			\item Computation time of parallel program: $\alpha n log log n / p$
			\item Number of broadcasts: $\sqrt{n} / log \sqrt{n}$
			\item Broadcast time: $\lambda \lceil log p \rceil$
			\item Reduction time: $\lambda \lceil log p \rceil$
			\item Expected parallel execution time:  $\alpha \frac{n log log n}{p} + \frac{\lceil log \rceil}{log \sqrt{n}} + \lambda \lceil log p \rceil$
		\end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}

\section{\Large Evaluation}\label{sec:eva}
\hspace{10mm}In this part, a comparison between sequential and parallel version. In the sequential, if n is equal to 100, the program will start at index 0 to index 99. In other words, sequential uses a global index to run the program. While parallel version, if n is equal to 100 and 4 processes are used, the block will contain four blocks, and each of them includes 25 indexes with the same number of size. So, it uses the local index.\\

\section{\Large Performance Results}\label{sec:perform}
\hspace{10mm}From (a)Sequential in Figure 1, all answer is 78498 numbers of prime from 1-1,000,000 and it uses 0.610000 seconds to execute. On the other hand, (b)Parallel in Figure 2, all answer is 78498 numbers of prime from 1-1,000,000 and it uses 0.009813 seconds to execute. Therefore, that means the difference is about the execute time.\\

\label{fig:compare}
\end{figure}
According to the figure 2, from these 3 processes, which are 4, 8, 16 processes. It shows that if use more processes it will be faster. However, it depends on the internet because we connect to the Mahidol server.



\section{\Large Discussion about the results}\label{sec:discuss}
\hspace{10mm}The difficult part is writing code from sequential process to make it operate together or how to make each process independent since we split into blocks. Other outside blocks cannot know how far that process is running. Due to that, we need to use a broadcast command to find k value to other blocks that they can access the same value. Then, we need to MPI\_reduce, to sum up, the results from all the blocks. Moreover, if the size of data is too large the runtime will be very slow. 

\section{\Large Analysis of the algorithm}\label{sec:analysis}
\hspace{10mm}The algorithm that we used will balance the process and speed up the runtime. Moreover, it is very complicated to define which block belongs to what process.

\section{\Large Further optimization}\label{sec:further}
\hspace{10mm}Remove the even numbers that are not number 2 or not add to the block at all so it will be easier to search and limited the communication so runtime process will take shorter.
